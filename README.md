# hass-melcloud

MELCloud integration for Home Assistant. Control your HVAC devices
through Home Assistant.

## Setup

Install by copying the `melcloud` directory to your `custom_compoents`
directory. Rest of the setup happens through the UI with a 
`config_flow`. Good times all around.

## Status

This thing is a wreck. The async set functionality is not OK and then
there's the mystery of token lifecycle. I'll sort that stuff out and PR
the whole thing to Home Assistant or something.
